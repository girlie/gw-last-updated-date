**Thesis Box to Display Last Updated Date**

_A handy way to add a "last updated" slug to your posts._

This Post Box dependent displays the date on which the post was most recently modified.

* Upload the `.zip` file via Thesis → Boxes → Manage Boxes → Upload Box.
* Once the box has been uploaded and appears in the list of available boxes, select its checkbox and then click the SAVE BOXES button.
* Go to Skin Editor → HTML, and choose the template you wish to edit.
* Add the Last Updated Date Box, then use `shift+drag` to place it inside the Post Box in your template.
* Save the template.
